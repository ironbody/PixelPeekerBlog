    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Simon Saberian and I am currently
      working as a DevOps engineer consultant at Roxtec! I have interests in both frontend and backend development, and I am
      always looking for new challenges to learn and grow.
    </p>

    <p>I graduated from Blekinge Institute of Technology in 2023 with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.</p>

    <p>My thoughts and opinions are my own.</p>
